# Stroke Shadow CSS (+ SCSS)

## What is it?
It's a very small CSS file that has setup text stroke, text shadow, box stroke and box shadow effects created in pure CSS. 

## How does it work?
Just add the classes to the element you want to style.

## Can I change the colours?
Yes, I have a test eviroment that you can use to see how that works. Basically I am variables in the `:root` and you just have to write over them. You can even go into the stroke-shadow.css file and change them if you want.

## I've used it and the stroke effect doesn't work too well with some fonts?
Sadly that is the case, it's also limited due to font size. In this situation I'd say play around with the stroke width and if that doesn't work then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ sorry.

## Does it come in SCSS?
YES! I've kept it very simple so you can easily switch it to SCSS, SASS, LESS or anyother CSS variant.

## Cool so does it come in SASS and LESS?
Not right now, that will be the next update though! :D
